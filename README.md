# sales-traffic-pull

This SQL code grabs sales and foot traffic data in separate CTE's and then joins them together.
The challenge was that traffic and sales data are contained in individual functions. Since you cannot join functions
in Microsoft SQL server, I needed a new way to bring the data together.
